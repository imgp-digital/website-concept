							<p>Silicon Valley Bank was a commercial bank headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and a subsidiary of SVB Financial Group until the bank's assets were transferred to a bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., due to failure.</p>
							
							<h2 class="fs-3 py-4">What Happened?</h2>
							
							<p>SVB's deposit base grew rapidly during the Covid-19 crisis, attracting investors with above market interest rates. In order to finance the deposit rates offered to savers, the bank invested in longer dated bonds and mortgage-backed securities &mdash; and crucially seems not to have hedged its interest rate exposure. With the rapid interest rates rises in 2022/23 these long dated securities have dropped significantly in value.</p>
							
							<p>US Banks are able to hold securities at cost on their balance sheets if they are classified as ‘Held to Maturity’; otherwise they must be regularly marked to market and are classified as ‘Available for Sale’ The below chart from JP Morgan Asset Management illustrates what an outlier Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB on the below) was from the peer group, and the scale of their problem.</p>
							
							<p>The other main issue at SVB was a very concentrated and ‘lumpy’ client base. The <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a> ensures deposits at US banks for amounts up to $250,000.  Staggeringly, 96% of SVB’s deposits were above this threshold.  When money started to move away from SVB, it moved rapidly and the bank quickly did not have the available liquidity to meet these withdrawals.</p>
							
							<h2 class="fs-3 py-4">The Resolution</h2>
							
							<p>The US Treasury announced on Sunday that all deposits at the bank (not just those up to $250,000 which are insured under federal law) would accessible this morning. In addition, the treasury also extended the same protection to a second bank, Signature Bank of New York, which regulators closed on Sunday as unease spread within the financial system. The Federal Reserve also <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was creating a new ‘Bank Term Funding Program’ for the nation’s banks, designed to provide liquidity against similar risks highlighted by SVB.</p>
							
							<h2 class="fs-3 py-4">The Impact</h2>
							
							<p>Market reaction has been understandably swift and negative. Equity markets have sold off between 4-5%, with financial stocks being particularly punished.  Perhaps more notably, Bonds and interest rates have had a much more regime-changing reaction.</p>
							
							<p>The below chart shows both the US (in green) and European (in blue) yield curves as of today and one week ago (March 6th).  As you can see, yields have fallen dramatically across the entire curve, with falls as high as 80bps in the 2-year portion of the yield curve as investors have interpolated SVB’s failure as the first major crack to appear in the economy as a result of the increase in rates.</p>
							
							<p>Future interest rate expectations have also rapidly repriced over the past week. Last Monday, market expectations were for the Fed to raise rates at the next meeting by 50bps, and continue raising them to a peak of 5.5% in the summer, then pause for an extended period of time.  Today, markets are predicting the Fed will raise rates 25bps at its next meeting (if it at all), before cutting rates back to 4% at the end of the year. This has been a massive change in outlook and sentiment, and whether this is just panic reaction, or a new paradigm remains to be seen.</p>
